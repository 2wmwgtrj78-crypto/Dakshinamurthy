   COACH. Everything here is computed from tracked data with no network at all:
   the diagnosis, the ranking of what is actually costing you, the debrief and
   the weekly review are arithmetic, not language modelling. An optional endpoint
   adds free-form conversation on top; when it is absent or offline the tab loses
   the chat box and nothing else. The rule is that no advice depends on the
   network, because a coach that goes quiet on a bad connection is worse than no
   coach at all.
